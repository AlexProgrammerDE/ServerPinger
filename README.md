# ServerPinger

A awesome discord Bot for pinging a minecraft server and displaying some stuff in discord.

## Installation
```
npm install && npm start
```

Thats all. The bot will start and do awesome stuff in the discord server.

## TODO
  * Make it so modular that it works across multiple servers (May need to remove some 6b specific stuff)
